Analysis of UCI’s Wine Quality Dataset (R, Linear Regression, ANOVA)
Extracted statistical differences among wine samples from UC Irvine’s Wine Quality dataset to find which ingredients had the largest impact on total quality as well as other hypotheses.

I analyzed a wine quality dataset from the University of California, Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository using R. This is actually one of two datasets, which, respectively, are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde'' wine, which consists of wine from the Minho region of Portugal. Portugal is currently one of the top exporters of wine in the world. The dataset contains the same variables(only for the white wine), where the inputs/independent avariables are physicochemical data, and sensory/output variables are also available (e.g. there is no data about grape type, brand, selling price, etc.). Input variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol. Fixed acidity is the number of grams of tartaric acid per cubic decimeter. Volatile acidity(wine spoilage) is calculated as the number of grams of acetic acid per cubic decimeter. Citric acid is measured per cubic decimeter. Residual sugar refers to the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, given in the number of grams per cubic decimeter. Chlorides refers to the number of sodium chloride grams per cubic decimeter of wine. Free sulfur dioxide is the number of grams of free sulfites per cubic decimeter of wine. Total sulfur dioxide is the number of grams of total sulfite(free sulfite+bound sulfite) per cubic decimeter of wine. Density is measured in grams per cubic decimeter. pH is used to measure the ripeness in relation to acidity. Sulphates refers to the number of grams of potassium sulfate per cubic decimeter of wine. Alchohol refers to the volume of alcohol in a percentage. Quality is a sensory variable where the quality of the wine is rated on a scale of 1-10.
